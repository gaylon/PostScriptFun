% The basic 'unit' of measure is the length of a hexagon's side.

% How many hexagons to draw...

% The obvious solution would be to write a function which draws
% one hexagon, and and call it repeatedly.
% But every side is shared between two hexagons, so that
% approach would draw every line segment twice.
% So, the basic building block here is six line segments
% which form half of two hexagons:
%         \      /
%          \____/
%   \      /
%    \____/
% This block can be tiled in a strictly rectangular array,
% with no overlapping lines.
