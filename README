Some PostScript coding... 
PostScript files are most often generated by printer drivers. 
But PostScript is a programming language, and you can write 
almost any program you want. 
This repo includes a few PostScript 'programs' I've written... 
You can 'execute' them by just opening them with GhostView, or 
just dumping them to a PostScript printer.

wallcalendar.ps  prints pages which can be taped together 
to form an infinite continuous calendar.  I like this format, 
for hanging on my cubicle wall, because it eliminates the 
artificial discontinuity between months. 

Then there's two which produce a pages of "graph paper", 
except that instead of a square grid, you get either triangles 
or hexagons.  I wrote these years ago, to do my homework in 
a grad class on cellular communications systems.
