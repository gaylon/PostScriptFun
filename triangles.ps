% The basic 'unit' of measure is the length of a triangle's side.

% The obvious solution would be to write a function which draws
% one triangle, and and call it repeatedly.
% But every side is shared between two triangles, so that
% approach would draw every line segment twice.  Further,
% half of the triangles are upside-down.
% So, the basic building block here is six line segments
% which form two triangles and half of a third:
%    /\
%   /__\
%   \  /
%    \/___
% This block can be tiled in a strictly rectangular array,
% with no overlapping lines.
